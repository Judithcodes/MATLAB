This is the BCJR Algorithm based Convolutional Code Decoder based on the example in the .pdf attached. This needs the Communication Systems Toolbox to work.

I am working on the Python implementation of this and it will be out soon.

This can be extended to decode the Parallel Concantenated Convolutional Code (PCCC) as explained by Berrou, Glaviuex et. al

Please cite this repository for future work.

The example uses a non-recursive systematic (7,5) convolutional code as an example.
