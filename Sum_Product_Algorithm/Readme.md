This is the Gallagher Sum product Algorithm for the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) and the Additive White Gaussian Channel (AWGN) respectively. The algorithm implementation on the BEC is not vectorized but the implementation on the BSC and AWGN are highly vectorized and optimized for performance.
