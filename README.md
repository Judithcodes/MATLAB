# MATLAB
A set of MATLAB/Octave codes that I wrote for Digital Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, RF Design etc., 

1. DTMF :
	This is used to simulate a DTMF transmitter and receiver on MATLAB/GNU Octave. There are a few functions that belong to the signal processing toolbox separately. I am working on a python implementation of this which will be soon added to this.

	This uses narrow band resonators at the reciver to detect the signals received. Please go ahead and make changes to the code for your application.  
	
	Please cite this repository if you are using it for your work.
2. VBLAST:
	This is used to simulated a weighted Successive Interference Cancelling (SIC) VBLAST receiver for a N x N MIMO system.

	This is partially vectorized and can be slow for higher values of N. The code has a few modifications to be made to work for Rectangular system.

	Stay tuned for a Python version of this code as well.
